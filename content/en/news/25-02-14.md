The book summarizes the findings that we've had in connecting Adam Smith's principles to current economic problems and them testing the solution as a moneyless system.

- From 2017-2019, we tested it for services
- From 2022-2024, we tested it for products (Supereconomics itself was created during the pandemic from 2020-2021 as a part of Superphysics)

To make the solution more permanent, it suggests new institutions as part of the 4th branch of government called the Resource branch:

1. Minimum Needs 
2. Points Banking 
2. Taxation in Kind
4. Pool Clearing
