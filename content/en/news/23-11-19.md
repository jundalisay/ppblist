We entered our MaHaRLiKa System in the Starlink Hackathon. It stands for **Ma**rket **Ha**rvest **Li**sting and **Ka**pacity-Building.

We wanted to test-deploy the system next month in a tribe in Kalinga Province.  Having a Starlink internet service would help immensely in our deployment. 

Unfortunately, we didn't make it to the semis.
