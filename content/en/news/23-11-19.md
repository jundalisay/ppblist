We pitched our MaHaRLiKa System in the Starlink Hackathon. It stands for **Ma**rket **Ha**rvest **Li**sting and **Ka**pacity-Building.

We wanted to test-deploy the system next month in a tribe in Kalinga Province.  Having a Starlink internet service would help immensely in our deployment. 

Unfortunately, we didn't make it to the semis, so we have to look for other satellite internet providers and pause the MaHaRLiKa System until we can get more support.

At the moment, we use DITO for our mobile data, since one of our members, Erick, works for DITO. We do hope that DITO will expand across the Philippines so that we can have more opportunities to test-deploy our system outside of the major cities.

<!-- At the moment, we have no choice but to test the offline version of the MaHaRLiKa System in rural areas using points-cards. -->


<!-- Our boycott suppliers are:
- AWS
- Starlink -->
