We joined the TON Hackathon to try to integrate crypto into Pantrypoints.

We began Pantrypoints in 2016 as a points-based system based on social contracts. We noticed that other at least 2 other startups took the idea using cryptocurrencies instead of points.

Back then, Ethereum was the main crypto that was available and so they used it for their prototypes. We also tried Ethereum and found problems with it:

- It was difficult to code 
- There was a lot of friction in onboarding and use
  - The gas fees are high
- It has high environmental impact

So we shelved the idea until we could find a better blockchain. We got introduced to TON, which stands for The Open Network, last year.

Compared to Ethereum, it was easier to connect to their API. Its defaul wallet was easier to use as it was integrated into Telegram. 

Our entry was the CommuniTON Pantry which uses TON to incentivize donors to donate to disasters.
