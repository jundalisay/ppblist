We overhauled the websites of [Pantrypoints](/), [Superphysics](https://www.superphysics.org), and [Maharlikanism](https://maharlika.superphysics.org) to use the same template. 


This is in line with our mega-overhaul which began on April 2021 when we unified Superphysics, Supersociology, and Supereconomics through the Four laws of Value.

This is also to make maintenance easier and to make them easier to understand for the general public.
