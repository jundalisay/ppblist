We joined the Connext AI Hackathon to prototype ISAIAH with Gemini. 

We didn't make any place we had little experience with Langchain. However, thanks to the hackathon, we learned about its alternative, Flowise. 

Gemini was the missing piece in ISAIAH Predict and we are so glad it was created by Google.
