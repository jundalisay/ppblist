From the start of the lunar new year, we will be testing Pantrypoonts overseas remotely. 

- In the Philippines, it will be Pantrypoints in reference to the community-pantry phenomenonn in 2021
- In Vietnam, where we began, it will be "Trao Đổi", meaning exchange
- In Pakistan, it will be "Adla Badli", also meaning exchange
