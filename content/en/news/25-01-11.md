We started out with a new economic science for our new economic system called NARA (Non Arbitrary Resource Allocation) way back in 2015 in Hanoi.

Back then, we were pitching our idea in hackathons and pitch events in Vietnam and we needed to form a team quickly. Some pitch events needed 5 people and we were only 3-4. 

Ngoc Anh gladly volunteered to fill the slot. In fact, she was team member number 2.
