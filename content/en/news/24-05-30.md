We began developing our scalable alternative economic system in October 2015 in preparation for a global stagflation crisis which our model predicted to begin in 2020. Our system would then be deployed to counteract that crisis. 


## The Success of the Prediction

The stagflation came in the time period that was predicted, but not in the form that we expected, as we expected the stagnation to come from a global warming drought, and the inflation to come from an Iran-Saudi or China-Taiwan war. Instead, the stagnation came from Covid and the inflation came from the Ukraine and Gaza wars.        

Nevertheless, the correct timing and qualitative results from the model validated the underlying science behind Pantrypoints which we call Supereconomics, which itself is a subscience of [Superphysics](https://www.superphysics.org).

It proved that it is possible to predict the future **generally**, but not specifically, since the aether* is always in flux and cannot be pinned down.

> *The aether is a fundamental substance in ancient Greek philosophy, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism and therefore in Superphysics.


In other words, Pantrypoints is an implementation of Supereconomics to harness the aether for economic purposes, just as a cellphone is an implementation of Physics to harness electromagnetism for communication purposes.

The success of the prediction, where reality itself is the laboratory, gives us the green light to trace backwards (or upwards) to apply the same principles to other areas of science such as Physics and Healthcare. We do this through our proposed science of Superphysics. 

## The Problem with Friends and Family

We began by giving out free copies of our draft Superphysics book to strangers to see their feedback. 

Usually, startups test their products on their friends and family who often give good feedback. They use such positive feedback to make their rosy projections which then become the basis for their fundraising or loan. When they sell to strangers, they get disappointed by the weak demand and so get themselves into financial trouble. 

By giving our product to strangers, we see right away the real reaction of the market. This allows us to improve our product for them, or to limit our projections.
