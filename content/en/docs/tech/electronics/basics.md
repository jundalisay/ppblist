Hertz flow-frequency (Hz) | Measure of frequency. It is how often something repeats itself 
Volt flow-force (V) | Measure of voltage as the pressure that pushes current 
Amp flow-rate (A) | Measures current as rate of flow through a conductor, similar to water flowing through a pipe
Ohm (Î©) resistance | Measures resistance.  Resistance opposes the flow of electricity in a circuit, like friction in a pipe.  

<!-- Higher resistance means it's harder for current to flow, even with high voltage.  Think of it like the narrowness of a pipe.  Wires have some resistance, and appliances have varying resistance depending on their design. -->


<!-- In electricity, hertz tells you how many times an electrical cycle (like the rise and fall of voltage) happens in one second.  For example, 60 Hz means the cycle repeats 60 times per second. Hertz isn't directly related to the flow of electricity (amps) or its pressure (volts) but describes the rate of change.

Imagine it like water pressure in a pipe.  Higher voltage means a stronger push, which can cause more current to flow (depending on the resistance).  In your house, you likely have outlets with 120 volts or 240 volts depending on the appliance.

  A higher amp rating means more electricity is flowing per second.  Think of it like the volume of water flowing.  Fuses and circuit breakers are rated in amps to prevent overload. -->


Hertz would be like how often you squeeze and release the trigger (cycles per second).

Volts would be like how hard you squeeze the trigger (water pressure).

Amps would be like how much water flows out per second (volume of flow).

Ohms would be like how narrow the hose nozzle is (resistance to flow).
