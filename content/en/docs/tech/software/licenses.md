## GPL (General Public License):

Copyleft: Requires derivative works (modified versions) to be released under the same GPL license.
Focus: Encourages open-source development and collaboration.
Restrictions: May not be ideal for commercial usage as it could require releasing your entire product as open-source.

Example: Linux kernel.


## MIT License:

Permissive: Allows users to use, modify, and distribute the software freely, including for commercial purposes.
Focus: Provides flexibility and promotes wider adoption.
Restrictions: Few restrictions, but contributors do not have to contribute back their modifications.

Example: ReactJS library.

## Apache License 2.0

This is similar to the MIT license, but with additional clauses regarding patent contribution.

## BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) License

Similar to the MIT license, with various versions having different specific terms.

## LGPL (Lesser General Public License)

Allows derivative works to be closed-source, but modifications to the LGPL-licensed code itself must be open-source.

The best license for your project depends on your goals and priorities. Here are some factors to consider:

Do you want to encourage open-source development and collaboration? (GPL)
Do you want to maximize adoption and allow commercial use? (MIT)
Do you need to be compatible with other specific licenses? (Apache, BSD)
Do you want to allow closed-source derivatives but require modifications to the original code to be open? (LGPL)
