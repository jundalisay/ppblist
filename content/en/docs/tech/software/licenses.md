## GPL (General Public License):

Copyleft: Requires derivative works (modified versions) to be released under the same GPL license.

Focus: Encourages open-source development and collaboration.

Restrictions: May not be ideal for commercial usage as it could require releasing your entire product as open-source.

Example: Linux kernel


## MIT License:

Permissive: Allows users to use, modify, and distribute the software freely, including for commercial purposes.

Focus: Provides flexibility and promotes wider adoption.

Restrictions: Few restrictions, but contributors do not have to contribute back their modifications.

Example: ReactJS library


## Apache License 2.0

This is similar to the MIT license, but with additional clauses regarding patent contribution.


## BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) License

Similar to the MIT license, with various versions having different specific terms.


## LGPL (Lesser General Public License)

Allows derivative works to be closed-source, but modifications to the LGPL-licensed code itself must be open-source.



The best license for your project depends on your goals and priorities. Here are some factors to consider:

License | Purpose
--- | ---
GPL | Encouraging open-source development and collaboration
MIT | Maximizing adoption and allowing commercial use
Apache, BSD | Compatibility with other specific licenses 
LGPL | Allowing closed-source derivatives while requiring modifications to the original code to be open
