Objects are non-primitive data kinds. 

```
let user: {
	name: string,
	age: number
};
```

To call the object: `user.name`


- object is all non-primitive values
- Object is the functionality of all objects

`[object] [Object]`



### Empty Object {}

```
let user: {};
```



## Enum

The enumerated kind uses constant values

```
enum Directions { N, S, E, W};
```
