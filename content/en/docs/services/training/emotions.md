Emotions are instinctive and neurological reactions to a stimulus, creating biochemical and electrical reactions activated through neuro-transmitters and hormones released by the brain (e.g., frightened by a sudden loud noise).

Emotions are messages to let us know how things are going at the moment. All emotions are useful and helpful. But, sometimes, it is helpful to be able to change the way we are feeling. 

Feelings are mental associations and reactions to an emotion that we assign with a particular meaning, influenced by our personal experiences, temperament, beliefs, memories, and thoughts (e.g., excited that your favorite sports team won the game).

The ability to change the way we feel is called self-regulation.


Relationship of Emotion to Thoughts and Behavior

The basic foundation of developing healthy coping skills and resilience building is understanding that thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are very much connected. 

We have control over all of these. 

It begins with our thoughts. Your thoughts influence your feelings and your feelings drive your behaviors.

The emotions we feel have a subjective, physiological, and expressive component â€“ how we experience the emotion and how our body reacts to the emotion can influence the actions we take and the decisions we make to help us survive, avoid danger, form social connections, and thrive.

All of our experiences are processed by our minds. The mind stores information from our past experiences, from things we have been taught, and also stores thought patterns. This is all filed away and informs our reactions and beliefs about the future.
