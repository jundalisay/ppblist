In CBT, we consider individual differences in training because CBT is self-paced. 

The design of training and instructional materials should suit each trainee.



## CHARACTERISTICS OF LEARNERS 

One important part of planning a training session is to analyze trainees so that the training suits their: 

1. Ability level 

2. learning styles & preferences 

3. Motivations 

4. Interests 

because they are the bases in choosing the methodologies to be used by the trainer. It is important to note that: 

a. CBT is customized and personalized. 

This is difficult to achieve if trainers are not aware of, either, the differences among trainees, or, how they may be able to work with these trainees to address their specific needs to allow them to demonstrate competence. 

b. The solutions are frequently applicable across different topics. c.Not all issues for trainers are issues for trainees. 

d. By altering some simple components of training, issues can be resolved; e.g. language issues - having assessment in the local language rather than in English.

Activist – Activists are people who learn by doing. 

They need to get into the action and experience what they’re trying to learn. These types of people typically have an open mind, they don’t come into situations with biases, they like to brainstorm, and they’re open to group discussions and problem-solving sessions.

Theorist – modelers

Learners who are inherently theorists seek to understand the theory behind the action. They enjoy following models and reading up on facts to better engage in the learning process. Theorists love reading stories and quotes, and they appreciate as much background information as they can get.

Pragmatist – experimenters

Pragmatists want to know how to put what they’re learning into practice in the real world. They don’t like abstract concepts or games. They experiment with theories, ideas, and techniques and take the time to think about how what they’ve done relates to reality.

Reflector –  watches people 

and thinking about what is happening. These kids observe from the sidelines and collect data, and then they take the numerous experiences they’ve perceived and work toward an appropriate conclusion.
