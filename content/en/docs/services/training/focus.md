Focus group discussions are used to gain knowledge about a particular topic or need by interviewing a group of people directly affected by the issue. Focus group data can be used to collect information for many purposes, such as conducting a needs assessment or evaluating a program.

Approaching Focus Group Facilitation


Two approaches are essential to facilitating focus groups.

·        The first is being a “blank slate.” This means approaching the focus group with an open mind and as few preconceptions as possible about what participants are likely to say or not say.

·        The other essential approach is to be aware of potential biases as a moderator. Differences in race/ethnicity, qualification handled and education levels between the moderator and participants can bring unforeseen biases to how a facilitator runs a focus group.

Encourage discussion

Ask participants to think about an issue for a few minutes and write down their responses.
Ask each participant to read, and elaborate on, one of their responses.
Note the responses on a whiteboard.

Once everyone has given a response, participants will be asked for a second or third response, until all of their answers have been noted.
These responses can then be discussed.

Don’t ask more than one question at a time, even if the questions go together. Participants usually cannot remember several questions at one time, and asking multiple questions makes it hard for them to know where to start
Frequently repeat key phrases from the question. Participants tend to lose focus on the question after 2-3 other participants have responded to it. 
Repeating key phrases from the question at strategic times, or asking participants to link their response to key terms in the question will help participants stay focused.

Be Comfortable with Silence. It is also important that moderators be comfortable with silence and “pregnant pauses.” Some participants may participate more if they have more time to consider the question before they speak.

Use probes when you need more information.

Managing risks


If one participant tries to dominate the session, the moderator should invite each person to speak in turn
Avoid interviewing friends in the same group as they can form cliques - if cliques do form, suggest taking a break and changing seating positions upon returning from the break

Avoid personal confrontation - allow the group to police itself (e.g., "do others in the group agree?")

Respect someone's right to be quiet, but do give them a chance to share their ideas 1-to-1 (e.g., during a break)

Use differences of opinion as a topic of discussion - the moderator should avoid taking sides

In order to avoid “leading” participants with any reaction to their comments, we suggest that reactions should be warm but value-neutral. Ways to be value-neutral are: information seeking (e.g., “tell me more about that…”), clarifying (e.g. “Can you explain what you mean?”) and acknowledging (“I hear what you are saying…”).
