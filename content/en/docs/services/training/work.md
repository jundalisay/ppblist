For work-based training conducted within the industry/company it is assumed that the necessary equipment and machineries are already available, although as a trainer, you have to check whether all of which are in place and can be used by the trainees during training. It is also important to discover, however, what additional materials will help. Books, pamphlets, diagrams, models may help trainees to develop their knowledge and skills more quickly.

If the work-based training shall be conducted within the training center, then it is even more important to build the correct range of resources. At this juncture the trainerâ€™s knowledge on the content of the training regulations will again come into use.

Note that trainers must identify from the list what are the required tools, equipment and materials; and facilities that the trainees would use to attain the required competency/ies based on the training plan. The trainer should also check with the person concerned the availability of these resources before starting the training.

It is important for trainees to know how well they are doing as they learn. This is because the knowledge that they are doing well gives trainees        a sense of achievement which motivates them to learn more. Similarly, it is also important to let trainees know when they have made a mistake so that they will learn from it and take corrective measures.

Feedback can be given to individual trainee, to a group of them, or to the whole class. It would be more efficient if the whole class can share in the monitoring process and the feedback.
