Work-based training assumes that the necessary equipment and machinery are available.

As trainer, you have to check whether all of which are in place and can be used by the trainees during training. 

It is also important to discover, however, what additional materials will help. Books, pamphlets, diagrams, models may help trainees to develop their knowledge and skills more quickly.

If the work-based training shall be conducted within the training center, then it is even more important to build the correct range of resources. At this juncture the trainerâ€™s knowledge on the content of the training regulations will again come into use.

Note that trainers must identify from the list what are the required tools, equipment and materials; and facilities that the trainees would use to attain the required competency/ies based on the training plan. The trainer should also check with the person concerned the availability of these resources before starting the training.

Monitoring is the routine assessment of ongoing activities and progress. It is the systematic and continuous assessment of the progress of      a piece of work over time. It is a basic and universal management tool for identifying strengths and weaknesses in a programmed. Its purpose is to help all the people involved make appropriate and timely decisions that will improve the quality of the work.

It is the primary role of the trainer to monitor the training. This is to ensure that trainees would attain the required competency at the end of the training program for them to be ready for the assessment.

## Training Plan

The training plan is the basis of the training of individual trainee. The industry supervisor should have a copy of this plan which shall serve as a reminder of individual trainee activities in the industry.

Always remember that work-based training should also be self-paced and individualized. Each trainee may have a different training plan from each other as a result of your activity in determining training needs. Work-based training should always be based on the training needs of individual trainee.

It is important for trainees to know how well they are doing as they learn. This is because the knowledge that they are doing well gives trainees        a sense of achievement which motivates them to learn more. Similarly, it is also important to let trainees know when they have made a mistake so that they will learn from it and take corrective measures.

Feedback can be given to individual trainee, to a group of them, or to the whole class. It would be more efficient if the whole class can share in the monitoring process and the feedback.
