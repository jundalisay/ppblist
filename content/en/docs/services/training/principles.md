## 1. The training is based on *competency standards*

<!-- curriculum developed from the -->

The Competency Standard (CS) is the written specification of the knowledge, skills and attitudes and values required for a job or performance. 
<!-- , occupation or trade and the corresponding standard of performance required for these in the workplace. -->

The industry workers identify these standards.

These are promulgated by the TESDA in the Training Regulations (TR).

The Competency Based Curriculum (CBC) is derived from the Competency Standards. 

It is a plan for structured learning experiences toward achieving competencies.

 <!-- identified by the industry;  -->

It details:
- training methodologies
- resources
- facilities
- infrastructure
- other materials 

These are required for training and assessment.


## 2. Learning is competency-based or **modular in structure**.

1 competency : 1 module.
- But some competencies may be divided into training modules.

A qualification is composed of competencies.

Your trainees should learn one competency after another, until they attain all competencies of the qualification.


## 3. Training delivery is *individualized and self-paced*

Provide activities to let each trainee advance on his own.

 <!-- without waiting for the other trainees in his class to finish. Facilities, resources and materials should also be structured so that trainees could learn competencies at their own pace. -->


## 4. Training is *based on work* that must be performed.


## 5. *Training materials* are directly related to the competency standards and the curriculum.

Competency Standards are updated specifications of the qualification.

Often, learning materials that are directly related to these standards are not available in bookstores. 

You should put your resources together to produce learning materials and learning activities appropriate to attain the performance criteria in the CS.

The Curriculum will be your guide to plan the training and assessment of your trainees.

Your learning materials should attain the assessment criteria in the CBC.


## 6. Assessment of learners is based in the *collection of evidences of work performance*

 <!-- based on industry or organizational required standards. -->


## 7. Training is based *on and off the job components* and off the job components.


## 8. The system allows *Recognition of Prior Learning* (RPL).

<!-- CBT focuses on the competencies that are not yet acquired by the trainee in any learning situation.  -->

Competencies acquired as a result of previous training, employment and life experiences should be recognized so that trainees will not waste time doing the learning activities of the competencies that they already have. 

You should identify these prior learning and plan the training of each trainee based on this data.


## 9. The learner can *enter and exit programs at different times and levels* and to receive an award for competencies attained at any point.


## 10. Approved training programs are *nationally accredited*.

Any program offered in TVET should be registered with the Unified TVET Program Registration and Accreditation System (UTPRAS). This covers the following:


### Program Registration

This is a compulsory compliance with minimum requirement prescribed in the Training Regulations(TRs) and anchored on competency-based system. 

Program registration prescribes full compliance with prevailing training standards, correction of sub-standard ones and denial of registration of registration for those who fail to comply. 

An integral part  of  program registration is the monitoring of registered programs for continuous compliance to standards.


### Program Accreditation 

This is a voluntary process of demonstrating quality assurance to  programs  and  institutional  processes  that shall lead to the recognition and conferment of  awards  various  levels of exemplary performance.

Compliance to UTPRAS would include  training  approaches, curriculum, learning materials, facilities, resources and other training materials. You should therefore learn how to plan and implement Competency-Based Training to comply with UTPRAS.

This training on Trainers Methodology is one of the requirements of UTPRAS.
