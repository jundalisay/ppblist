Training design is a systematic process that develops education and training programs.

Instructional Design, also Instructional Systems Design (ISD) creates "instructional experiences which make the acquisition of knowledge and skill more efficient, effective, and appealing." 

It is made up of:
- determining the current state and needs of the learner
- defining the end goal of instruction
- creating some "intervention" to assist in the transition. 

Ideally, the process is informed by pedagogically (process of teaching) and andragogically (adult learning) tested theories of learning and may take place in student-only, teacher-led or community-based settings. 

The outcome of this instruction may be directly observable and scientifically measured or completely hidden and assumed. 

The ADDIE model has 5 phases:

1. Analysis - analyze learner characteristics, task to be learned, etc. Identify Instructional Goals, Conduct Instructional Analysis, Analyze Learners and Contexts 

2. Design - develop learning objectives, choose an instructional approach Write Performance Objectives, Develop Assessment Instruments, Develop Instructional Strategy 

3. Development - create instructional or training materials Design and selection of materials appropriate for learning activity, Design and Conduct Formative Evaluation 

4. Implementation - deliver or distribute the instructional materials 

5. Evaluation - make sure the materials achieved the desired goals

Plan and prepare for installation LO2. Install equipment/device system LO3. Conduct test In most cases, the trainer would immediately proceed to the installation of computer called “assemble and disassemble”. But if we were to analyze the first LO training should start with planning and preparing for installation. Let us analyze the assessment criteria of LO1. 1.Installation planned and prepared to ensure that safety measures, policies and procedures followed, and that work is appropriately sequenced in accordance with the industry standards 2.Technicalpersonnelconsultedtoensurethatthework coordinated effectively with others involved on the worksite 3.Computer systems and network devices obtained in accordance withtheestablishedproceduresandtocomplywith requirements 4.Location where devices and systems to be installed is determined from job requirements 5.Materials necessary to complete the work obtained in accordance with established procedures and checked against job requirements 6.Tools, equipment and testing devices needed to carry out the installation work obtained in accordance with established procedures and checked for correct operation and safety 7.Preparatory work checked to ensure that no unnecessary damage hasoccurredandthatworkcomplieswith requirements The first challenge here is to identify the main task to be mastered. Then identify the other tasks that are essential to the attainment of the main task. In analyzing the criteria look for the verbs that would signal a skill to be done. In the first criteria, the verbs are “planned and prepared”. The verbs that follow are “consulted”, “obtained” and “checked”. The main skill here would be planning and preparation for the
