Training design is a systematic process that develops education and training programs.

Instructional Design, also Instructional Systems Design (ISD) creates "instructional experiences which make the acquisition of knowledge and skill more efficient, effective, and appealing." 

It is made up of:
- determining the current state and needs of the learner
- defining the end goal of instruction
- creating some "intervention" to assist in the transition. 

Ideally, the process is informed by pedagogically (process of teaching) and andragogically (adult learning) tested theories of learning and may take place in student-only, teacher-led or community-based settings. 

The outcome of this instruction may be directly observable and scientifically measured or completely hidden and assumed. 

The ADDIE model has 5 phases:

1. Analysis - analyze learner characteristics, task to be learned, etc. Identify Instructional Goals, Conduct Instructional Analysis, Analyze Learners and Contexts 

2. Design - develop learning objectives, choose an instructional approach Write Performance Objectives, Develop Assessment Instruments, Develop Instructional Strategy 

3. Development - create instructional or training materials Design and selection of materials appropriate for learning activity, Design and Conduct Formative Evaluation 

4. Implementation - deliver or distribute the instructional materials 

5. Evaluation - make sure the materials achieved the desired goals

Plan and prepare for installation LO2. Install equipment/device system LO3. Conduct test In most cases, the trainer would immediately proceed to the installation of computer called “assemble and disassemble”. But if we were to analyze the first LO training should start with planning and preparing for installation. Let us analyze the assessment criteria of LO1. 1.Installation planned and prepared to ensure that safety measures, policies and procedures followed, and that work is appropriately sequenced in accordance with the industry standards

Then identify the other tasks that are essential to the attainment of the main task. In analyzing the criteria look for the verbs that would signal a skill to be done. In the first criteria, the verbs are “planned and prepared”. The verbs that follow are “consulted”, “obtained” and “checked”. The main skill here would be planning and preparation for the




Adults must want to learn In addition to communicating the learning objectives we need toshow how the learner and their work will benefit from thetraining. • Use overviews to engage thelearner • State benefits in the outline of each topic and includinglearning activities that reinforce thebenefits • Providing self assessments as a prelude to the module ortopic • Create personas to assist you to focus on thelearners Adults generally havea concept of being responsible for theirown decisions. Keep this in mind and incorporate it in the learning. If youtake this away from them then you will be undermining their ability to engagein thetraining. 

The most potent motivation for adult learners are internalpressures (self esteem, life quality). So meet these needs. Allow and encouragepeople to explore, recognise their achievements and apply them to theirlearning andtraining. 

Learner Orientation Adults will learn only what they feel they need tolearn Adults must feel the things they are learning are relevant and willbe useful. So make the links to the work they are doing or could be doing inthe futureby: • Including examples and case studies on how others have usedthe knowledge orskills CBLMs onTrainers Methodology LevelI PlanningTraining Sessions Date Developed: July 2010 Date Revised: March 2012 DocumentNo. Issuedby: NTTA Page 79 of251 Developed by: Redilyn C.

• Provideopportunitiesforthelearnertocontroltheirlearning environment • Using a problem – solutionapproach Adults are task centered or problem centered in their orientationto learning. So make sure you look at issues, and how to work throughthem, and keep ontrack. You need to lead them to discover their own solutions for issues,not tell them what to do. Encourage your learners to work together, todiscuss, debate and share ideas andinformation. Experience Adults learn by comparing past experience with newexperience Adults bring to a wealth ofexperience and knowledge intotheir learning activities. When they learn something new most check how thisfits in or is different from what they alreadyknow. In developing and using learning materials we should devise wayto tap into this knowledge and to provide frameworks or models that assistthe learner to establish relationships between whatthey know andthenew knowledge orskill. Sharing of personal experiences or stories is one waythiscanbe achieved. Orientation toLearning Adults need immediate feedback concerning theirprogress We need to provide opportunities for learners to track their progress andto get constructive feedback on their learning. Providing selfassessment questionnaires or check lists and quizzes are useful techniques forlearners to track their progress. Make sure answers are readilyavailable. Orientation toLearning Adults want their learning to bepractical Adult interest in learning surges when we can provide exercisesthat provide the experience of applying a new concept or skillto a ‘reallife’ situation. Try to provide opportunitiesfor learners to link their learningwith people, issues or activities in theirlives.



1. Gain attention of the students
Ensure the learners are ready to learn and participate in activities by presenting a stimulus to capture their attention.

These are a few methods for capturing learners’ attention:

Stimulate students with novelty, uncertainty, and surprise
Pose thought-provoking questions to students
Have students pose questions to be answered by other students
Lead an ice breaker activity

2. Inform students of the objectives

Inform students of the objectives or outcomes for the course and individual lessons to help them understand what they are expected to learn and do. Provide objectives before instruction begins.

Here are some methods for stating the outcomes:

Describe required performance
Describe criteria for standard performance
Have learners establish criteria for standard performance
Include course objectives on assessment prompts

Inform students of the objectives or outcomes for the course and individual lessons to help them understand what they are expected to learn and do.

3. Stimulate recall of prior learning
Help students make sense of new information by relating it to something they already know or something they have already experienced.

There are numerous methods for stimulating recall:

Ask questions about previous experiences
Ask students about their understanding of previous concepts
Relate previous course information to the current topic
Have students incorporate prior learning into current activities


4. Present the content

Use strategies to present and cue lesson content to provide more effective instruction. Organize and group content in meaningful ways, and provide explanations after demonstrations.

The following are ways to present and cue lesson content:

Present multiple versions of the same content (e.g. video, demonstration, lecture, podcast, group work, etc.)
Use a variety of media to engage students in learning
Incorporate active learning strategies to keep students involved
Provide access to content on Blackboard so students can access it outside of class

5. Provide learning guidance

Advise students of strategies to aid them in learning content and of resources available. In other words, help students learn how to learn.

The following are examples of methods for providing learning guidance:

Provide instructional support as needed – i.e. scaffolding that can be removed slowly as the student learns and masters the task or content
Model varied learning strategies – e.g. mnemonics, concept mapping, role playing, visualizing
Use examples and non-examples – examples help students see what to do, while non-examples help students see what not to do
Provide case studies, visual images, analogies, and metaphors – Case studies provide real world application, visual images assist in making visual associations, and analogies and metaphors use familiar content to help students connect with new concepts

… help students learn how to learn
6. Elicit performance (practice)
Have students apply what they have learned to reinforce new skills and knowledge and to confirm correct understanding of course concepts.

Here are a few ways to activate learner processing:

Facilitate student activities – e.g. ask deep-learning questions, have students collaborate with their peers, facilitate practical laboratory exercises
Provide formative assessment opportunities – e.g. written assignments, individual or group projects, presentations
Design effective quizzes and tests – i.e. test students in ways that allow them to demonstrate their comprehension and application of course concepts (as opposed to simply memorization and recall)
7. Provide feedback
Provide timely feedback of students’ performance to assess and facilitate learning and to allow students to identify gaps in understanding before it is too late.

The following are some types of feedback you may provide to students:

Confirmatory feedback informs the student that they did what they were supposed to do. This type of feedback does not tell the student what she needs to improve, but it encourages the learner.
Evaluative feedback apprises the student of the accuracy of their performance or response but does not provide guidance on how to progress.
Remedial feedback directs students to find the correct answer but does not provide the correct answer.
Descriptive or analytic feedback provides the student with suggestions, directives, and information to help them improve their performance.
Peer-evaluation and self-evaluation help learners identify learning gaps and performance shortcomings in their own and peers’ work.

Provide timely feedback of students’ performance to assess and facilitate learning and to allow students to identify gaps in understanding…
8. Assess performance
Test whether the expected learning outcomes have been achieved on previously stated course objectives.

Some methods for testing learning include the following:

Administer pre- and post-tests to check for progression of competency in content or skills
Embed formative assessment opportunities throughout instruction using oral questioning, short active learning activities, or quizzes
Implement a variety of assessment methods to provide students with multiple opportunities to demonstrate proficiency
Craft objective, effective rubrics to assess written assignments, projects, or presentations

Implement a variety of assessment methods to provide students with multiple opportunities to demonstrate proficiency.
9. Enhance retention and transfer
Help learners retain more information by providing them opportunities to connect course concepts to potential real-world applications.

The following are methods to help learners internalize new knowledge:

Avoid isolating course content. Associate course concepts with prior (and future) concepts and build upon prior (and preview future) learning to reinforce connections.
Continually incorporate questions from previous tests in subsequent examinations to reinforce course information.
Have students convert information learned in one format into another format (e.g. verbal or visuospatial). For instance, requiring students to create a concept map to represent connections between ideas (Halpern & Hakel, 2003, p. 39).
To promote deep learning, clearly articulate your lesson goals, use your specific goals to guide your instructional design, and align learning activities to lesson goals (Halpern & Hakel, 2003, p. 41).



Training Delivery Modes





The following Training Activity Matrix is recommended to schedule and monitor the use of the facilities and resources. This Training Activity Matrix should work hand in hand with your session plan. The session plan    is a plan for the whole qualification and for trainees with different learning styles while the training activity matrix is a daily plan which will show the activities of each trainee.

This Matrix is a monitoring tool of trainees’ activities for the trainer. The Vocational Instruction Supervisor and the administrators may also look for this matrix when monitoring competency-based trainings. This matrix, along with a well-prepared session plan, is a good indicator that the training being implemented is using the CBT approach. The trainer may print a copy of this plan or he may keep it to his computer. It is recommended that this matrix is updated daily.
