Vested interests (food importers, agribusinesses) don't need to worry because food is not commercial grade. 

conversion of value into a tangible natural object, historically as grains. This is to remove the time value of money. A debt of $1 today will be really worth $0.50 in 10 years because of inflation. To offset this injustice, creditors charge interest rates that pile up so that they will get $2-4 or more, causing an injustice to the debtor. This leads to debt slavery and farmer suicides. 

Pointizing a debt converts it to the rice equivalent where 1 kilo is 1 point. If 1 kilo of rice is $1, then the debt is 1 point. This point can be paid in money after 10 years in whatever will be price of rice then. To pay for the maintenance of the loan records, the creditor can assign a markup, such as 5% or 50 grams 

Money is for things that already has a known or obvious value. Examples are utilities, long-running products and services, experienced employees and professionals.

Points are for things that have a value that is unclear or abstract. Examples are new ideas and inventions, forests, environmental protection, community security, traditional culture, morals, fresh graduates, career switchers and apprentices. 

Moneyless investment - investor gives an equipment that is used by the entreprenuer to produce value some of which goes to the investor to pay for his investment. For example, a shredding machine is given to shred neem leaves into powder as additive for antiseptics and pesticides. 


The circular economy itself is a natural effect of a points system, where value is pegged to grains (representing life), just as the linear economy is an effect of a money system where value is pegged to gold (representing utility or usefulness). This focuses on rel;ationships instead of utiltiy. 
Risks and Mitigation

The utility aspect is addressed with behavior aspects. 
 Singapore towns are well-planned with community centers. Composting machine. 

In our experience, large grocery chains already have agreements with food banks to distribute unsold food. It is the many small ones that do not have food waste plans, as it is very convenient to dispose of their food waste in the trash. 
Ancient systems for resource allocation i.e. to bring food on the table) that were in line with Nature. 
Project Outcomes 
Surplus food and vibrant vegetable gardens for the duration of the program. 
Increased community interaction 
Building a transactions history for participants in the program 
 What are the metaphysical nature of human behavior via behavioral profiling.

Project Background
In theory, the hub can also process unfinished meals. 
DALI says it runs its inventory so efficiently that it has no food waste to give. 
After harvest, the plots look messy. 
Take it for granted. 
Composting takes away food waste from the landfills and puts it in the people’s homes to go into the plants. We have tried upcycling large plastic bottles, such as gallon jugs, into pots but the community has complained about their ugliness. Some local governments paint them to make them attractive, but this incurs cost. 

The proponent has not witnessed the composing machine in operation noise and energy use. 
Initial excitement until the effort is not. Someone can destroys someone’s crop. 
The system is designed to be run by the community without government intervention. This is because political changes can cause funding to be withdrawn by rival parties or politicians who will then push their own contractors. For example, party can waste-to-energy plant that will force food waste into that centralized facility instead.  This will require a lot of financing and will be by finance people to give themselves employment. 
Toiletries, detergent, cooking oil, condiments, coffee. We used coconut products such as cooking oil, virgin coconut oil, coconut vinegar. The project was jumpstarted by the proponent making a website for one of the associations of the Coconut company which was paid for in coconut products. The proponent 
There seems to be a demand for oils such as for aromatherapy and massage and skin and hair, such as coconut oil for hair that is not addressed by manufacturers.



Valuation method:

Each box is valued according to the highest-quantity item. This is to simplify the process and encourage the donor to add more high value food waste.

The market value of the item is then reduced depending on its usability:

1% of the price for items on or past the expiry date
1-5% for items 1 week before expiry 
5-20% for items 3 months before expiry
20-40% for items 6 months before expiry

For example, 1 box had: 

- 18 packets Halls candies
- 9 Irish cream drinks
- 9 packets broth cubes 

The box will be valued according to Halls candies. 

The value is then pegged to the cheapest rice which is now 37 pesos per kg, which represents 1 point. Therfore, the point credit for the box is .  

- 2 large boxes of chocolates
- 900 grams brocolli
- 1 kg sugar
- 1 packet banana
- 250 grams cauliflower
- 500 grams sitaw
