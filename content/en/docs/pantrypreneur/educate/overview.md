Mobile  | Pantrypreneur  Educate is a small-school offline administration system

## Intent

It focuses on helping teachers manage their students. It comes from our own experience as teacher-students:

- Klock + Query 
- Appraise
- Jobs

From the TESDA training in 2024, we put up the idea that it should do learning outcomes together with info guides and self-checks
