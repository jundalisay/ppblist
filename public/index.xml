      <description>Pantrypoints and Pantrypreneur are the implementations of Supereconomics, which is a subset of Social Superphysics.&#xA;Pantrypoints is for society as an enterprise (Social Enterprise Resource Planning or SERP). This facilitates the common interest. Pantrypreneur is for private business or enterprise (Micro-Small Enterprise Resource Planning or MERP). This facilitates the private or personal interest. Tech development starts from Social Superphysics and moves &amp;lsquo;west&amp;rsquo; towards Material Superphysics.&#xA;For example, Pantrypreneur Farm links the moneyless sale of agricultural products in Supereconomics with the proposed farming system called Maximized Farming of Agricultural Superphysics.</description>

      <description>Name Descrption Hertz flow-frequency (Hz) Measure of frequency. It is how often something repeats itself Volt flow-force (V) Measure of voltage as the pressure that pushes current Amp flow-rate (A) Measures current as rate of flow through a conductor, similar to water flowing through a pipe Ohm (Ω) resistance Measures resistance. Resistance opposes the flow of electricity in a circuit, like friction in a pipe. Hertz would be like how often you squeeze and release the trigger (cycles per second).</description>

      <description>Elixir is based on functions in functions in functions.&#xA;Functions have a complicated syntax. To simplify them, the functions are organized into &amp;ldquo;macros&amp;rdquo; by defmacro.&#xA;Macros are evaluated at compile time and must return quote expression.&#xA;These are then used to define constants and DSLs. But macros are really just reused functions.&#xA;Quote quote substitutes {function, metadata, arguments} usually {Expression, Modules, Nested Expressions}&#xA;quote translates whatever is in it as AST which has precedence.</description>

      <description>In 2015, our economic model predicted a global stagflation hitting by 2020, as a consequence of the profit maximization doctrine of Economics, as well as the Keynesian quantitative easing that supports it.&#xA;This is why, from 2016, we have been creating a moneyless points-based economic system to address such an inflation.&#xA;This all was tested in 2020 when our app suddenly got a lot of users &amp;ndash; these were people in lockdown or those who have lost their jobs because of the pandemic.</description>

      <description>In 2012, our economic model predicted a global stagflation starting in 2019 sparking the Crisis Years.&#xA;The 1970&amp;rsquo;s stagflation was caused by the Israel-Arab wars of 1967 and 1973. So we assumed that the 2020&amp;rsquo;s stagflation would be caused by an Iran-Saudi war which would then cut oil from the Strait of Hormuz. This seemed to come true when Trump assassinated Soleimani on January 3, 2020, guaranteeing some military retaliation by Iran.</description>

      <description>Last week, we pitched our Pantrypreneur Farm system to Makati Rotary Club but couldn&amp;rsquo;t get any significant reception for the idea.&#xA;So we decided to pause it and focus on Pantrypreneur Educate which was relatively undeveloped.&#xA;By sheer coincidence, we met the lead administrator for AMSAI E-Learning on the same day. She was willing to implement our proposed moneyless tuition system.&#xA;We also partnered with AF Organic, an organic farm in Paranaque, to use exchange points for some of their transactions.</description>

In the Philippines, we will implement this VCF as &amp;ldquo;Basurayuda&amp;rdquo;, which is a program that mobilizes unemployed people to collect plastic waste and kitchen waste to be recycled and turned into compost.&#xA;This system relies on communities and moneyless systems in order to create a &amp;ldquo;common economy&amp;rdquo; powered by &amp;ldquo;common interest&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>One of the early mistakes that we made as a startup was to use one system on one server for both web app and website.&#xA;We thought that this would be sustainable, especially since we relied on mostly on interns and volunteers. Everyone would learn one framework and work on one repository and one branch.&#xA;The mistake exposed itself when our server actually got website views and web app users. This overloaded our server causing it to either crash or incur charges when it auto-scaled to accomodate the traffic.</description>

      <description>In line with our mega-overhaul that began in April, we&amp;rsquo;ve renamed Social Resource Allocation (SORA) into Pantrypoints, as well as reorganizing all apps and features.&#xA;The main catalyst was finding out the error of Einstein in his Theory of General Relativity . This then made it easy to match the laws of thermodynamics to our laws of value which then became the solid foundation of Supereconomics as implemented through community pantries during the pandemic.</description>

      <description>In order to keep the Pantrypoints app resilient, it does not use image hosting which would increase the system&amp;rsquo;s cost and reduce maintainability. Instead, we use hotlinking which shows images hosted by other websites and apps.&#xA;There are generally two kinds of hosting services for image:&#xA;1. File hosting These host files for storage purposes. Examples are:&#xA;Google Drive Dropbox 2. Image hosting These host images and video for serving over the internet, usually through a CDN (content delivery network).</description>

The Covid pandemic has wreaked havoc on cash and many customers are unable to pay their suppliers.&#xA;Fortunately, our proposed economic system, called Pantrypoints , derived from Adam Smith, is purpose-built to predict and solve such problems. In fact, we have been warning of a huge global economic crisis as early as 2015.</description>

      <description>Update June 2020: In 2015, our model predicted a huge global crisis starting in 2019 to be felt many years afterwards. This is now known as the Covid-19 pandemic. Our model predicts inflation next, as a result of governments applying sophistical mercantile solutions, now known as &amp;ldquo;bailouts&amp;rdquo;, on supply and demand problems. These bailouts will be paid for by either inflation (as college debt, rising bills, rent, etc) or by increased taxation, both will lead to unrest (as seen in the US riots) or a change in government.</description>

      <description>I decided to begin NARA or Non-Arbitrary Resource Allocation to implement my paper that predicts a coming crisis after the year 2018.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for web development companies, and I estimate that it will take 3 years to develop the NARA online economic system in time for that crisis.&#xA;The paper itself began in 2012. I started exploring different web frameworks in 2014. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried:&#xA;PHP-Wordpress Java-Spring MVC Scala-Play Groovy-Grails Ruby-Sinatra Python-Flask So far, the winner seems to be Python Flask, especially since it can be easily deployed on Google App Engine.</description>

      <description>Asker What is Pantrypoints? Pantrypoints It&amp;rsquo;s a points-based economic system that implements the grain-based valuation proposal of Adam Smith in &amp;ldquo;The Wealth of Nations&amp;rdquo;. Asker What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with the current economic system? Pantrypoints It&amp;rsquo;s based on selfishness. This leads to a growing gap between the rich and the poor. Asker What&amp;rsquo;s the problem with inequality? I&amp;rsquo;m already rich. Why should the poverty of others be my problem? Pantrypoints The increase of poor people leads to crime, malnutrition, low-intellect, unemployment, overcrowding in cities where the poor gather to find work, etc.</description>

      <description>Pantrypoints arose from Juan&amp;rsquo;s personal research on the 2008 Financial Crisis which led to the 2008 Food Crisis, 2011 Arab Spring, and the Eurozone crisis.&#xA;The 2008 Financial Crisis arose from Allan Greenspan not doing his job of regulating the banking industry, citing Adam Smith who advocated non-regulation. So Adam Smith should be such an evil guy for causing so much trouble, right?&#xA;By going through Adam Smith&amp;rsquo;s works, we saw that he actually advocated the strict regulation of banking, comparing it to the building of firewalls to prevent the spread of fire .</description>
