      <description>One of the early mistakes that we made as a startup was to use one system on one server for both web app and website.&#xA;We thought that this would be sustainable, especially since we relied on mostly on interns and volunteers. Everyone would learn one framework and work on one repository and one branch.&#xA;The mistake exposed itself when our server actually got website views and web app users. This overloaded our server causing it to either crash or incur charges when it auto-scaled to accomodate the traffic.</description>
