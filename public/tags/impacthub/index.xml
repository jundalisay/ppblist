      <description>We joined Impacthub Smart Cities to pitch the last part of the Pantry system &amp;ndash; Pantry Govern.&#xA;From the event, we were able finalize the features :&#xA;Permit and Issue tracking Local transportation routes map Local News (as Pantry Beacon) This completes all the platforms and features of the Pantry system. Because we didn&amp;rsquo;t get support back in 2016, development progressed very slowly. It came too late for the crisis that we predicted in 2019 which turned out to be Covid-19.</description>

How can small farmholders who have no tech, no money, and are illiterate better manage their farm operations to increase yields and profits? How can farm tourism thrive with real-time information on carrying capacity?</description>
