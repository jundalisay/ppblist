      <description>Pantrypoints City is the public, base platform for points-transactions between users as mutual customers of each other.&#xA;This is different from the other Pantry Platforms where transactions are of a hierachal-level such as boss-employee or customer-supplier.&#xA;Intent Pantrypoints City is for generating blue collar or freelance employment (giving and finding work) by facilitating a moneyless points system. This is because City facilitates same-level transactions.&#xA;White collar and regular jobs are facilitated by the private Pantrypreneurplatforms such as Educate, Rewards, and Farm.</description>
