      <p>Communication is the transfer of information.</p>
 <!-- by conveying intended meaning to another entity through the use of mutually-understood means.   -->
<h2 id="4-principles-of-osgood-schramm-model-of-communication">4 principles of Osgood Schramm Model of Communication</h2>
<ol>
<li>Circular Communication not linear</li>
<li>Equal and reciprocal Communication</li>
<li>Messages require interpretation</li>
<li>3 steps for communicating: encoding, decoding and interpreting.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are 2 parties:</p>
<ol>
<li>The sender (origin encoder)</li>
<li>The receiver (decodes and interprets).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="types-of-messages">Types of Messages</h3>
<ol>
<li>Verbal messages - words</li>
<li>Non-verbal - body language, lights, sounds, pictures and symbols, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="one-way-and-two-way-communication">One way and Two way Communication</h3>
<p>Sending a message is one-way.</p>
<p>Communication is completed when the receiver sends a feedback; and therefore, becoming a two-way communication.</p>
<p>The medium is the tool utilized in order to transfer the message.</p>
 <!-- It could be through use of your voice (face to face, phone calls), text (letters and SMS), or electronic (email, social media).  The channel is the sense you want to involve while using the media, such as visual (pictures), auditory (sounds), or kinesthetics (body language interpretation) -->
<p>An example is a &ldquo;no smoking&rdquo; signage which has:</p>
<ul>
<li>text (the word)</li>
<li>the icon (the picture)</li>
<li>the color (red-indicating fire hazard)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="effective-questioning">Effective Questioning</h2>
<p>The correct question-asking technique promotes better understanding for a successful communication. It has to be done in:</p>
<ul>
<li>the right time
<ul>
<li>The way you ask the question determines the kind of answer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the right manner</li>
</ul>
<p>Asking questions conveys interest, level of engagement, or even intelligence. It is also used as a means of evaluating something.</p>
<h3 id="proper-way-of-asking-questions">Proper Way of Asking Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create clear questions that will basically get the vital information using the 4W and 1H (Who, What, Where, When and How)</li>
</ol>
<p>Be neutral and not accusatory.</p>
<p>Communicate directly obvious and clear. Don’t muddle your message by adding filler words such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>&lsquo;about&rsquo;</li>
<li>&lsquo;maybe&rsquo;</li>
<li>&lsquo;a little bit&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Structure the question</li>
</ol>
<p>Choose words that are familiar, unambiguous, and easily understood.</p>
<p>Provide concrete examples, if possible.</p>
<p>Pay attention to your listener to make certain they understand the language that you are using.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use steady eye contact and appropriate body language expressing interest and willingness to encounter and accept new conclusions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Use the appropriate tone of voice that will convey that the conversation is collaboration - aimed towards making things better. In the same manner, your nonverbal communication should complement what you say. When the two differ, your listener will believe your nonverbal cues and tend to ignore what you are saying.</p>
<p>Avoid distracting habits such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>crossing your arms</li>
<li>putting your hands in your pockets</li>
<li>handling a cell phone</li>
<li>turning away from people when you ask questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Practice moving purposely instead.</p>
<p>Actively listen to the response and pause at the end of a question so that the person will have time to think, formulate, and deliver an answer.</p>
<p>Do not interrupt to show your interest in the response. Block physical distractions like background noise, interruptions, uncomfortable temperatures, and busy environments. If possible, close the door, turn off a cell phone, or suggest that you and your listener find a quieter interaction</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Have something to note or write the response.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restate or enhanced the question if the answer is vague or respectfully request for a repetition if inaudible to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be open-minded by showing respect for responses are views not in accordance to our view; or use silence for responses that are hostile</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="types-of-communication-media">Types of Communication Media</h2>
<p>Verbal media include face-to-face meetings, telephone calls, voice mail, and video conferences.</p>
<p>Choose a medium that is appropriate for the message that you are sending. Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>the complexity of your message</li>
<li>the costs of a potential misunderstanding</li>
<li>your listener’s ability to understand you</li>
<li>the urgency of your message.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1-physical-media">1. Physical media</h2>
<p>The talking person can be seen and heard. This shows the body language and the climate. It can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>a face-to-face conversation or</li>
<li>videoconference and webinars.</li>
</ul>
<p>1.a. Large meeting</p>
 <!-- - in some occasions, majority of the people involved are gathered in for a meeting. This channel works very well when you need to get across strategic and important messages to a large group of people at the same time, creating a wide attention, get engagement or communicate a sense of belonging. Large meetings  -->
<p>This is excellent for urgent matters, brain storming, or when announcing information concerning the organization.  However, there may be less opportunity for dialogue</p>
<p>1.b. Departmental meetings</p>
 <!-- a certain department may communicate daily operative issues, gives status reports and solves problems localized in their work area. This medium involves smaller group that is usually presided by the department head.  -->
<p>This gives good opportunities for dialogue with less involvement of the personnel in the higher ranks.</p>
<p>1.c. Personal</p>
<p>Few people meet either randomly or as scheduled to discuss and answer questions.</p>
<!-- It can be done with two or more people in a place agreed prior or in a place where a casual conversation lead to a semi-business or office meeting. -->
<p>1.d. Viral communication</p>
<p>This uses social networks</p>
 <!-- to produce increases in awareness or knowledge through self-replicating viral processes. It can be word-of-mouth delivered or enhanced by the network effects of social media. -->

<p>This type of medium utilizes written or electronic channels. These channels is fast but impersonal.</p>
<!-- Due to the "absence" of the person, voice or appearance, it is up to the receiver of the message to interpret the message.  This can be very useful in archives for messages. -->
<p>2.a E-mail</p>
 <!-- - or Electronic mail is one of the most commonly used form of communication in the work place.  It is a good channel for the daily communication to specific target groups. It is suitable for fast and up-to-date exchange of information.  E-mail allows attachment of files, photos, and other documents, and possess features for easy storage and retrieval of e-mails.  -->
<p>2.b. Memos and announcements</p>
<p>Usually, announcements are made through memorandum.</p>
  <!-- This usually contains short but vital information that is circulated in print or intranet for the awareness of the entire organization.  This serves as a notice with brief instruction or message.  -->
<p>2.c. Printouts</p>
<p>Examples are billboards, company manuals, newsletter, or company brochures</p>

Good examples are facebook, twitter, instagram, etc. More and more companies are using social media in their external marketing or as communication platform but these channels are considered personal.  -->
<p>Its use for business communication should be minimized.</p>
<h2 id="flow-of-communication">Flow of Communication</h2>
<!--      Good communication is an essential tool in achieving productivity and maintaining strong working relationships at all levels of an organization. An institution that invests time and energy into delivering clear lines of communication will rapidly build trust among employees, leading to increases in productivity, output and morale in general.

      Possessing the ability to communicate effectively with co-workers, managers and customers is a hallmark of a service provider considered to be valuable assets to an organization.  

An organization with effective communication system often defines the working atmosphere, and sets apart the satisfaction of the employees and of the clients from others.   Poor communication in the workplace will inevitably lead to unmotivated staff that may begin to question their own confidence in their abilities and inevitably in the organization. -->
<!-- ### Direction of Communication in an Organization                          

At this point, it is good to have a good understanding of the organizational structure of the company that is usually represented by an organizational chart.

<p>Team Member Roles
Types of Team in the Organizational Workplace</p>
<p>All workplace teams have the common element of people working together cooperatively and members possessing a mix of skills.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Self-Managing Work Teams</p>
<p>This is sometimes referred to as the self-directed team. A self-managing work team is a small group of employees responsible for managing and performing technical tasks to deliver a product or service to an external or internal customer. Such teams perform a wide variety of manufacturing and service activities and work in an extremely integrated and collaborative way because they don’t have a formal leader. Members define the division of labor, responsibilities and the distribution of tasks, as well as make decisions and even control and supervise themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cross/Multi-Functional Teams</p>
<p>A cross-functional team is a work group composed of workers from different specialties, at about the same organizational level, who come together to accomplish a task. The people from different specialties are supposed to blend their talents. This type of work team is usually formed to develop work with a multidisciplinary view, in which each area represented by team members complements the knowledge of others, bringing more creative and comprehensive results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task Force team</p>
<p>This is sometimes referred to as special purpose team. They form only when emergency situations emerge which the organization needs to solve. Its members are usually the best of the company in the area. During the resolution of the emergency, they will dedicate themselves exclusively to this task. Their goal is to do this in the best way and in the shortest possible time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project team</p>
<p>These are work groups an organization creates to implement a specific project until completion. Afterward, the group dissolves as it achieved its objectives. Typically, members come from different areas of the company and perform other tasks related to their home department.  But, as far as the project is concerned, they answer to the project leader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtual Teams</p>
<p>Some teams conduct most of their work by sending electronic messages to each other rather than conducting face-to-face meetings. A virtual team is a small group of people who conduct almost all of their collaborative work by electronic communication rather than face-to-face meetings.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Different Team Roles</p>
<pre><code>It's important to define a role for each member of a team, based on her personal strengths and preferences. According to MindTools, Dr. Belbin, a prominent researcher, identified nine different roles that members of a team will naturally adopt. If you are aware of these roles, you can work to create more balanced teams with a broad range of talent and fewer weaknesses. By being aware and respectful of different styles, team members can also work together more sympathetically.



 Researcher R. Meredith Belbin came up with nine team roles through a study conducted at Henley Management College. He identified the team roles after observing the behavioral tendencies of individuals within a group (see Fig. 2b). Belbin describes a team role as &quot;a tendency to behave, contribute and interrelate with others in a particular way.&quot; The team roles consist of three categories: action-oriented roles, people-oriented roles and thought-oriented roles. Teams formed on the basis of Belbin's categories are effective in achieving their objectives because there are no overlapping roles or missing qualities in the team.
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Action-oriented Role - focus on improving team’s performance, putting ideas into action, and meeting deadlines</li>
</ol>
<p>a.  Shaper</p>
<pre><code> In a team, the shaper role is performed by people who are dynamic and relish challenges. Rather than quit when faced with challenges, shapers maintain a positive mental attitude and strive to find the best ways to overcome challenges facing the team. Shapers are extroverts and possess great interpersonal communication skills and work toward motivating other team members.
</code></pre>
<p>b. Implementer</p>
<pre><code> People who play the implementer role in a team are those who actually get things done in the team. They are practical, efficient and well-organized. Implementers turn the team’s ideas and thoughts into actual plans. Because of their conservative nature, implementers are rather rigid and slow to accept change in a team.
</code></pre>
<p>c.  Completer/ Finisher</p>
<pre><code> Finishers have an eye for detail. In a team, they're regarded as perfectionists because they're the ones who detect errors or omissions and strive to ensure that the team adheres to deadlines. They're neat and self-conscious and worry at the slightest sign of a problem. Finishers also have a problem with delegation; they would rather be overwhelmed than share their work with others.
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>People-oriented Role - bring people and ideas together</li>
</ol>
<p>a. Coordinator</p>
<pre><code> Coordinators are seen as possessing the traditional team role. They're mature and confident in nature and possess great listening skill. They guide the activities of the team to what they identify to be the team's obligations. Coordinators are good at delegating duties, but they may be manipulative when it comes to directing the team toward what they perceive to be its goals.
</code></pre>
<p>b. Team Worker</p>
<pre><code> Team workers are the people who ensure the team remains united. They work toward resolving conflict or issues affecting the team’s dynamics. Team workers are very supportive of other team members and are thus popular within the team. Team workers are known to be non-committal during decision making because they don’t want to be seen as taking sides: they put team cohesion ahead of their decision-making abilities.
</code></pre>
<p>c. Resource Investigator</p>
<pre><code> Resource investigators are inquisitive and enthusiastic in nature and possess great negotiating and networking skills. They are extroverts, which makes it easy for others to relate to them. Through their networking skills, resource investigators develop external contacts and negotiate for the team's resources. They are quick thinkers and good at getting information from other people.
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<pre><code>Thought-oriented Role -analyze options and provide technical expertise.
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>a. Monitor-Evaluator</p>
<pre><code> These are the critical thinkers in a team. They're serious minded and cautious in nature. Rather than rush into decision making, they prefer to critically analyze information before making any conclusions. Monitor-evaluators lack the energy to motivate other team members and are deemed to be slow in decision making.
</code></pre>
<p>b.  Specialist</p>
<pre><code> Workers with expert knowledge in a particular area comprise the specialist role. Their contribution to the team is limited only to their area of expertise. Their priority is in maintaining their professional standards. Though they show great pride in their area of expertise, they show little or no interest in the expertise of others. Because of their expert knowledge, they're indispensable members of a team.
</code></pre>
<p>c.  Plants</p>
<pre><code> Plants are innovative members of the team. They come up with original approaches and ideas that help the team in solving problems or overcoming challenges. Plants are introverts in nature and possess poor communication skills. Plants prefer to work alone. They react well to praise but are greatly affected by negative criticism.
</code></pre>
<p>Stages of Team Growth</p>
<pre><code> Groups go through a set of predictable stages of development. In 1965, Bruce Tuckman, who carried out research on group dynamics, identified the four stages (see Fig. 2a) as forming (getting to know each other); storming (initial confrontation as group members identify their differences); norming (coming together to work for the benefit of the team); and performing (working well together with a process to deal with any differences of opinion and reassessing to look for opportunities for improvement)
</code></pre>
<p>Team development</p>
<pre><code> Teams don't just form and immediately start working together to accomplish great things. It undergoes stages of team growth; and teams must be given time to work through the stages and become effective.
</code></pre>
<p>Stage 1: Forming.</p>
<pre><code> When a team is forming, members cautiously explore the boundaries of acceptable group behavior. They search for their position within the group and test the leader's guidance. It is normal for little team progress to occur during this stage.
</code></pre>
<p>Stage 2: Storming.</p>
<pre><code>  This is probably the most difficult stage for the group. Members often become impatient about the lack of progress, but are still inexperienced with working as a team. Members may argue about the actions they should take because they faced with ideas that are unfamiliar to them and put them outside their comfort zones. Much of their energy is focused on each other instead of achieving the goal.
</code></pre>
<p>Stage 3. Norming.</p>
<pre><code> During this stage team members accept the team and begin to reconcile differences. Emotional conflict is reduced as relationships become more cooperative. The team is able to concentrate more on their work and start to make significant progress.
</code></pre>
<p>Stage 4. Performing.</p>
<pre><code> By this stage the team members have discovered and accepted each other's strengths and weaknesses, and learned what their roles are. Members are open and trusting and many good ideas are produced because they are not afraid to offer ideas and suggestions. They are comfortable using decision making tools to evaluate the ideas, prioritize tasks and solve problems. Much is accomplished and team satisfaction and loyalty is high.
</code></pre>
