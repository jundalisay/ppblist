      <description>Name Descrption Hertz flow-frequency (Hz) Measure of frequency. It is how often something repeats itself Volt flow-force (V) Measure of voltage as the pressure that pushes current Amp flow-rate (A) Measures current as rate of flow through a conductor, similar to water flowing through a pipe Ohm (Î©) resistance Measures resistance. Resistance opposes the flow of electricity in a circuit, like friction in a pipe. Hertz would be like how often you squeeze and release the trigger (cycles per second).</description>
